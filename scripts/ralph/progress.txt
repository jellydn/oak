## Codebase Patterns
- Swift Package Manager is used instead of Xcode project files (more reliable for CLI builds)
- Notch companion is a borderless, non-activating panel window positioned at top-center of screen
- Session state uses enum with associated values (SessionState) for type-safe state machine
- ViewModels are marked with @MainActor and use @Published for SwiftUI binding
- Timer uses Timer.scheduledTimer with weak self to avoid retain cycles
- Use `swift build` from Oak/ directory to build and verify typecheck

## [2026-02-12 23:23] - US-001
Session: N/A
- What was implemented:
  - Created macOS app project with Swift and SwiftUI using Swift Package Manager
  - Implemented notch companion UI (NotchWindowController) that displays as floating panel at top-center
  - Added NotchCompanionView with SwiftUI for the UI
  - Implemented FocusSessionViewModel with timer functionality
  - Created SessionModels with SessionState enum and Preset enum
  - Primary action button starts 25-minute focus session (with preset selection for 25/5 or 50/10)
  - Session state changes to running immediately on button click
- Files changed:
  - Oak/Package.swift - Swift Package Manager configuration
  - Oak/Sources/Oak/Oak.swift - Main app with all code (merged for SPM)
  - Oak/Oak/OakApp.swift - App entry point
  - Oak/Oak/Models/SessionModels.swift - SessionState and Preset enums
  - Oak/Oak/ViewModels/FocusSessionViewModel.swift - Timer and session logic
  - Oak/Oak/Views/NotchCompanionView.swift - SwiftUI notch interface
  - Oak/Oak/Views/NotchWindowController.swift - Window management
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Swift Package Manager is easier to work with than manual Xcode project files for CLI builds
  - To build: `cd Oak && swift build` (builds successfully)
  - Notch window uses NSWindow with .borderless and .nonactivatingPanel style
  - NSApp.setActivationPolicy(.accessory) hides app from dock
  - Window level .floating keeps it above other windows
  - Use `[weak self]` in timer closures and invalidate in cleanup()
  - SwiftUI in AppKit requires NSHostingView wrapper
