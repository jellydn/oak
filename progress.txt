## [2026-02-13 00:24:00] - Initial setup
- Created prd.json from markdown PRD
- Initial code structure exists with basic implementation
- Tests pass

## [2026-02-13 00:26:00] - US-001
[Session: ]
- Notch companion is visible and interactive when app is running
- One primary action starts a 25-minute focus session
- Session state changes to running within 500ms of user click
- Typecheck/lint passes
- Files changed:
  - Oak/Tests/OakTests/US001Tests.swift (added)
  - Oak/Oak/ViewModels/FocusSessionViewModel.swift (added selectPreset method)
  - Oak/Oak/Views/NotchCompanionView.swift (removed Spacer)
- Tests: All 5 tests pass (1 smoke test + 4 US-001 tests)
**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Use `@MainActor` on ViewModels to ensure thread safety
- Test state transitions (idle → running → paused → idle)
- Test computed properties and edge cases (0 values, boundary conditions)
- XcodeGen project must be regenerated when adding new test files: `cd Oak && xcodegen generate`
- The project uses SwiftUI + AVFoundation stack for macOS 13+
- Tests should follow XCTest framework with @MainActor for ViewModels
- Commit format: `feat: [Story ID] - [Story Title]`

## [2026-02-13 00:26:00] - US-002
[Session: ]
- MVP supports only two presets: 25/5 and 50/10
- Users can switch preset before session start
- Work and break durations follow selected preset exactly
- Typecheck/lint passes
- Files changed:
  - Oak/Tests/OakTests/US002Tests.swift (added)
- Tests: All 10 tests pass (1 smoke + 4 US-001 + 5 US-002)
**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Test only public API - don't access private properties/methods in tests
- Use computed properties like `displayTime` instead of internal state for assertions
- The `selectPreset()` method already existed in FocusSessionViewModel from previous work
- Tests should verify both enum values and runtime behavior
- XcodeGen project regeneration required after adding test files: `cd Oak && xcodegen generate`
