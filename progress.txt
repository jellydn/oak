- Tests pass

## [2026-02-13 00:26:00] - US-001
[Session: ]
- Notch companion is visible and interactive when app is running
- One primary action starts a 25-minute focus session
- Session state changes to running within 500ms of user click
- Typecheck/lint passes
- Files changed:
  - Oak/Tests/OakTests/US001Tests.swift (added)
  - Oak/Oak/ViewModels/FocusSessionViewModel.swift (added selectPreset method)
  - Oak/Oak/Views/NotchCompanionView.swift (removed Spacer)
- Tests: All 5 tests pass (1 smoke test + 4 US-001 tests)
**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Use `@MainActor` on ViewModels to ensure thread safety
- Test state transitions (idle → running → paused → idle)
- Test computed properties and edge cases (0 values, boundary conditions)
- XcodeGen project must be regenerated when adding new test files: `cd Oak && xcodegen generate`
- The project uses SwiftUI + AVFoundation stack for macOS 13+
- Tests should follow XCTest framework with @MainActor for ViewModels
- Commit format: `feat: [Story ID] - [Story Title]`
